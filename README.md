I am a junior high school student in Beijing and a computer novice.

- I am proficient in switching on and off of various operating systems and Hello World in various programming languages.
- I like to try new technologies, but I can't say I'm good at it.
- I have a strong interest in artificial intelligence, but not at a high level.

> Note: My English may not be very good :(
